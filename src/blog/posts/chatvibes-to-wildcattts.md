ChatVibes has officially rebranded to **WildcatTTS**.  
This update gives the TTS service a clearer identity and a cleaner dashboard.

### Bot username change
As part of the rebrand, the Twitch bot’s username is changing:

- **Old:** `ChatVibesBot` 
- **New:** `WildcatTTS`

### Do I need to do anything?
For most users, everything should continue working normally. Let me know if you encounter issues.

### What’s changed?
- New bot username
- Updated documentation at [https://docs.wildcat.chat](https://docs.wildcat.chat)  
- No data loss — all voices, settings, and ignore lists are preserved

Thanks for using the service. If anything looks off, let me know.
