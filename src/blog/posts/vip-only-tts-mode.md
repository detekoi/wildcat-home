Hey everyone! I've just rolled out a new feature for ChatVibes TTS audio.

### **What's New?**
You can now restrict Text-to-Speech to **VIPs** (plus Mods & Broadcaster)! 

This is the perfect middle ground when "Everyone" is too chaotic but "Mods Only" is a bit too quiet. Give your trusted VIPs a voice!

### **How to use it:**
Streamers and Mods can set the permission level using the following command:
`!tts permission vip`
Or select "VIPs Only" from the TTS Permission dropdown in the web UI.

### **Permission Levels Recap:**
* **`everyone`** / **`all`**: The wild west! Everyone's messages are read.
* **`vip`**: Only **VIPs**, Moderators, and the Broadcaster can trigger TTS.
* **`mods`**: Strictly for Moderators and the Broadcaster.
