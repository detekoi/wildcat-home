I’ve rolled out an update to the [**ChatVibes Dashboard**](https://tts.wildcat.chat/) that gives you direct control over voice volume and per-voice volume calibration.

### Voice Volume Control
You can now adjust the **volume** for your channel’s default voice directly in the dashboard. This lets you fine-tune TTS levels without touching OBS faders.

### Voice Calibration Mixer
Different voices come in at very different levels. The new **Voice Calibration** section lets you:

- **Balance individual voices** by setting per-voice volume levels
- **Set it once** — calibrated voices will always play at that level, including when used via `!myvoice`
- **Keep audio consistent** even when chat switches between very different voices

### How to use it
1. Go to [https://tts.wildcat.chat/](https://tts.wildcat.chat/)
2. Log in and scroll to **Voice Calibration**
3. Select a voice, adjust the slider, and click **Save**
   - *Note: values above 1.0 may be loud or distort — test carefully*
