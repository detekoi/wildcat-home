You can now configure a list of banned words and phrases for WildcatTTS. Any chat message containing a banned word or phrase will be silently skipped by TTS — filtered out.

### How to use it

1. Head to your [WildcatTTS Dashboard](https://tts.wildcat.chat/).
2. Scroll down to the new "Banned Words / Phrases" section (right below the Ignore List).
3. Type a word or phrase and click Add.
4. That's it — messages containing those words won't be read aloud anymore.

### Good to know

- Case-insensitive — adding "BadWord" will also catch "badword", "BADWORD", etc.
- Phrase support — you can ban full phrases like "follow my link", not just single words.
- Substring matching — banning "spam" will also catch messages containing "spammer" or "spammy".
- Add or remove words at any time from the dashboard — changes take effect immediately.

This gives you more granular control over what gets read on stream, beyond just ignoring specific users. Suitable for filtering out repetitive spam phrases or unwanted content.
