My knowledge bot has a new name.

**ChatSageBot** is now **WildcatSage**.

This is a branding update only. The bot will continue doing exactly what it does now — answering questions, minigames, translations, and supporting game integrations — just under a new name in chat.

### Important note for streamers
If you use a Text-to-Speech (TTS) service, especially **WildcatTTS**, you may need to update your ignore list.

- If you previously blocked `ChatSageBot` from being read aloud by TTS, you’ll need to **add `WildcatSage`** to your ignore / blocked users list as well.
- This ensures the bot’s messages remain silent during stream.

You can review your settings at [https://tts.wildcat.chat](https://tts.wildcat.chat) (or through your preferred TTS provider) to make sure everything is set up before your next stream.

Thanks for your continued support.
